[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mtn/silver.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mtn/silver)

Silver is a high-level toy language. It compiles to JavaScript.

**Status**: Silver is complete, but lacks most features that would make it interesting. For example, there is no way to create side effects (i.e. print to the screen). I'm leaving it this way so I can move on to new projects that I can learn new things from.
